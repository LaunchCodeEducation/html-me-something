                                <h1>Memories of my trip to Hilton Head Island in South Carolina</h1>
                                <!--<img src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:104px;height:142px;"></img>-->

                                    <p class = "memories">Some friends and I decided to plan a trip a few years ago.  Eric's family owned a time share in South Carolina, so we decided to
                                    plan a trip to go there.  We made our flight reservations and off we went!  I was living in Kansas City at the time.  My friends lived
                                    in Virginia.  We arrived in Atlanta and drove to South Carolina.  Our adventure was just about to begin.</p>

                                <h2>Exciting Adventures</h2>
                                    <p class ="memories">During our first full day at Hilton Head it was decided amongst the group that we would go parasailing and then jet skiing.  I <head>
                                        never parasailed or went jet skiing before.  For the parasailing adventure I decided to "go along for the ride". Jet skiing sounded fun and I agreed
                                        to participate.  I got on the parasailing boat with my friends and watch with excitment as they each took their turn to parasail and returning to
                                        share their excitement of the ride.  After some time of "coaching" from the boat operator I found myself being strapped in and preparing to take off.
                                        Exciting, Fear and Joy are some of the feelings that I had.  Not sure if I'll ever do it again, but it is definitely something I'll never forget.
                                        We then went jet skiing....pure joy!

                                <h3>The Lighthouse</h3>
                                    <p class ="memories"> The are two structures that I find fascinating.  One of the structures are lighthouses.  The other is the Gateway Arch.
                                    During my trip to Hilton Head I had the opportunity to see a lighthouse.  The image can be found below.  I believe that you can take a trip
                                to the top of the lighthouse.  Unfortunately, we did not do that during our trip.</p>
