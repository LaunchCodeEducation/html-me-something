    <h2>Italy</h2>
    <img src = "../../../Images/Rome.jpg">

    <p> I traveled all over northern Italy. There were many cities to see, including Rome, Florence, Bologna, Milan, Venice, and Genoa.
    One thing that I learned while in Italy is that you should never drive there. <br>It's pretty chaotic and there are no rules on the road!
    Now, that said, the food was really quite wonderful, and many of the vistas there were quite beautiful as well.</p>

    <h2>Latvia</h2>
    <img src = "../../../Images/riga.jpg">
    <p>Riga was a beautiful city that actually had significant German architecture, showing it's heritage. I visited during the summer so there were flowers everywhere within the city. The food was absolutely
    fantastic and the people were very friendly. <br>Perhaps most notably, the sky never actually got black there at night, instead it stayed at a deep blue color, likely due to how north the country is located.</p>

    <h2>Lithuania</h2>
    <img src = "../../../Images/lith.jpg">
    <p>I stopped in a small town there that bordered another country.
    You can see the difference in normal and Soviet Architecture</p>

    <h2>Russia</h2>
    <img src = "../../../Images/moscow.jpg">
    <p>I mainly stayed within Moscow while visiting. Getting into Russia is significantly more challenging than other countries as it requires a visa &amp; I had one at the time. Moscow itself
    is a massive city that has tons of Soviet bloc era architecture.<br> That is to say, it's pretty drab. Nonetheless, the subway systems there were quite beautiful, with mosaics and chandeliers unique. </p>

    <h2>Germany</h2>
    <img src = "../../../Images/frankfurt.jpg">
    <p>There's not much to say about Germany unfortunately. I had been there in the past, but I was little and dont remember much. I was at the Frankfurt airport for some time before my flight.
    <br>I was rather annoyed because they wouldn't let me keep my water even though it was unopened. As far as the folks went, everyone there was very polite.</p>

    <h2>Addendum<h2>
    <p> I honestly got extremely lucky when I left and came back. As it turns out, Russia was about to invade Georgia due to border tensions, and shortly afterwards, they expelled Americans from the country.<br>
        So by sheer luck I managed to avoid that particular moment in history and was already on a plane. It's really kind of odd how things just shake out.</p>
