      <h1>Tedda Boom Boom - the Beginning </h1>

      <p>I was born on March 6 to a passionate mother and an ambitious father. I was their firstborn...together and separately.<br> As I entered this realm, I knew my destiny. I just wasn't sure I wanted to stay on that course. I mean really.<br>
          This greatness in me just couldn't contain itself. I had an immediate relationship with God and understood <br>that faith would see me through anything. </p>
        <h1> A Blessed & Wild & Crazy Childhood </h1>

        <p>So much love! I received more love than my little heart could hold. My brother was born and then my sisters. A zillion cousins always around. <br>

        My grandmother was my rock. I could tell you I was a millionaire because I never wanted for anything. <br>
        I loved my little town and my friends. Hated the demons of the world. God helped me to diminish their existence.</p>
        <h1> Fasten Your Seatbelts - Turbulence </h1>

        <p>Okay, talk about going from sugar to sh*t. Maybe my security in my God kept me from doing my daily work to sustain a relationship. <br>I got cocky. Ungrateful. Rebellious. I took every
        wrong turn. Why? Because I could. And then in small moments,  I would be reminded <br>who I was and whose I was. Only then, slowly, did I even
        think about coming back to center.<br>

        <br>How much pain, hurt, anger, destruction could one soul take and actually survive? I was going to be the testament. No doubt. </p>
        <h2>Redemption - Renewal - Connection - Oneness </h2>
        <img src="http://www.mushroom-magazine.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/om-symbol-purple.jpg" />
        <p>Why was I torturing myself when I knew from the moment I was born that greatness, happiness were me? <br>
        They were my destiny even before I was birthed. I decided it was time to be the I Am that I Am called me.<br> I became a mother and this being
        deserved to be connected to her Source, know her power. <br>Who else to teach her but the one whose heartbeat was her first song. <br>
        So for me and for her and for my world, I've stepped into my true self. <br>I no longer deny my talents and gifts. I am here to share them and express them to and with and for the world!</p>
