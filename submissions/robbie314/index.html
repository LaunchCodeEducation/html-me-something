      <h1>Tedda Boom Boom - the Beginning </h1>

      <p>I was born on March 6 to a passionate mother and an ambitious father. I was their firstborn...together and separately. As I entered this realm, I knew my destiny. I just wasn't sure I wanted to stay on that course. I mean really.
          This greatness in me just couldn't contain itself. And even though I had a "big head" of sorts, I had an immediate relationship with <span class="bold"> God</span> and understood that faith would see me through anything. </p>
        <h1> A Blessed & Wild & Crazy Childhood </h1>

        <p>So much love! I received more love than my little heart could hold. My brother was born and then my sisters. A zillion cousins were always around. I mattered in a sea of beautiful brown smiling faces.</p>

        <p>My grandmother was my rock. I could tell you I was a millionaire because I never wanted for anything.
        I loved my little town and my friends. Ignored the demons of the world. <span class="bold">God</span> helped me to diminish their existence.</p>
        <h1> Fasten Your Seatbelts - Turbulence </h1>

        <p>Okay, talk about going from sugar to s**t. Taking<span class="bold"> God </span> for granted kept me from doing my daily work to sustain a relationship. I got cocky. Ungrateful. Rebellious. I took every
        wrong turn. Why? Because I could. So I turned towards the world and away from my heart. My heart held everything. The world offered tricks and deception covered by good and bad intentions from the wrong people.</p>

        <p>How much pain, hurt, anger, destruction could one soul take and actually survive? And then in small moments, I would be reminded who I was and whose I was. Only then, slowly, did I even
        think about coming back to center. I was going to be the testament. No doubt. </p>
        <h1>Redemption - Renewal - Connection - Oneness </h1>

        <p>Why was I torturing myself when I knew from the moment I was born that greatness, happiness were me?
        They were my destiny even before I was birthed. I decided it was time to be the I Am that I Am called me. Besides a soul, I became an artist, a teacher, a poet. I became a mother and this being
        deserved to be connected to her <span class="bold">Source</span>, know her power. Who else to teach her but the one whose heartbeat was her first song?
        I became a wife and learned to see God in others. So for me, I've stepped into my true self. No more denying my talents and gifts. I am here to share. To express. To BE!</p>
