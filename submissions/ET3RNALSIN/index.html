<p>My journey to my car started online.I was really excited at first because I
  was in a much better position in order to get the car I wanted.I started out
  looking at articles and websites trying to pin down the type of car that I
  wanted to commit to.After days of reading and searching,I had it finally down
  to the Honda Accord Coupe.Now it was on to the search to find the perfect car.
</p>



<h3>The Search</h3>

<p>After finding the car I wanted I had the fabled mindset that it should be a
breeze now that I then picked out the car. I was so wrong and then some and I learned
quite quickly that the road to the car was going to be rough.I started pinpointing
several cars and once I did that I started calling around to ask about them. The
problem I kept running into was that the car would either be on hold for someone
or was about to be sold or not ready to be shown off yet but yet they had it on
online to show off.</p>

<h2>The Purchase</h3>
