                        <p>New to Saint Louis, I've forced all of my friends and family to visit local tourist attractions.
                            Most have been willing specimens in this experiment. This page will highlight some of our adventures within Saint Louis,
                            as well as attractions close to Saint Louis.</p>

            <h3 class="lightblue">Places I Remember</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Here: Fair Saint Louis 2015</li>
                        <p>Yeah, that's Debbie Harry from Blondie and I couldn't believe that she looked this good at 71.</p>

                    <li>Here: Busch Stadium: Pirates vs. Cardinals</li>
                        <p>Cardinals lost 5-2.<p>

                    <li>There: Kansas City's Boulevard Beer</li>
                        <p> So not anywhere close to Saint Louis, couldn't resist a flight of beers in Kansas City</p>
                            <img id="greenborder" src ="/Users/SandraLaguerta/code/html-me-something/submissions/SLaguerta/images/DSC08501.jpg">
                    <li>There: Canoeing on the Current River</li>
                        <p>A friend decided to do this for her birthday on a Saturday morning/afternoon. Great escape from the city.</p>

                    <li>Everywhere: Paul McCartney's One on One Tour</li>
                        <p>A return to Busch Stadium but for something better than the Cardinals.
                            Three-hour concert, fifty years after The Beatles' first visit to Saint Louis.</p>
