					<h3>Story pt.1</h3>

					<p>Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. They were just sucked into space. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I'll be sure to note that in my log. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. You enjoyed that. The unexpected is our normal routine. Ensign Babyface! I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Not if I weaken first. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Your shields were failing, sir. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Sorry, Data. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly!</p>

				<h3>Story pt.2</h3>
				<p>Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Computer, belay that order. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. We have a saboteur aboard. Computer, lights up! This should be interesting. Talk about going nowhere fast. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Damage report! and attack the Romulans. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Besides, you look good in a dress. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. What? We're not at all alike!</p>

				<p>Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Well, that's certainly good to know. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. I am your worst nightmare! You bet I'm agitated!</p>

					<h3>Story pt.4</h3>
					<p>I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Your head is not an artifact! The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. How long can two people talk about nothing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll alert the crew. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you.</p>
