                    <p>
                        Bees are some of the most industrious creatures around.
                        They pollinate flowers, make honey, and give great high fives.

                    <p>
                        You never know what's going to happen when a bee is around.
                        It could sting you, it could buzz around happily, or it could
                        advertise a cereal to you.

                    <h2>Bees are Dying</h2>
                    <p>
                        However, due to parasites, pesticides, and a lack of gentic
                        diversity bees have been dying at an upsetting rate. Which saddens me.
