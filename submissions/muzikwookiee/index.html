                    The original <em>Chicago Tribune</em> newspaper headquarters was burned in
                    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a>.
                    In 1922, $100,000 in prize money was offered by the paper in an international design competition for
                    their new building. The winning entry, out of over 260, was a neo-Gothic design by John Mead Howells
                    and Raymond Hood. The top of the tower is designed after the <em>Tour de beurre</em> ("butter tower")
                    of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral">Rouen Cathedral</a> in France.

        Marina City is the honeycomb/corncob looking buildings in the middle. In 2014, Nik Wallenda walked
        partly blindfolded across a 600&nbspfoot high tightrope over the Chicago River and between the two towers.<br><br>
        The Carbide & Carbon Building, lower center with the gold crown, is a shining example of Art Deco architecture.
        It is currently home to the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago, with its 37 floors providing nearly 400 guest rooms.
        It was designed by the Burnham Brothers, sons of the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham">Daniel Burnham</a>,
        who played significant roles in the master plans of many cities, including Chicago, and is also the designer of the insanely&#8209recognizable

        Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower, although unfortunately named, should not be judged by its owner. The building was designed by Adrian Smith of AS+GG, the same
        firm responsible for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah_Tower">Jeddah Tower</a>, the 1&nbspkm tall building under construction in Saudia Arabia. Trump Tower was originally
        announced to be the tallest building in the world, but following 9/11, Trump reduced the height.

                            Buckingham Fountain's 3 pumps recirculate 14,000 gallons of water per minute through 134 jets.
                            Financed and envisioned by Kate Buckingham, she wanted the fountain to produce an aura of "soft moonlight"
                            through glass filters and the fountain's 820 lights. <br><br>
                            Navy Pier is a 3,300 foot long pier jutting out into Lake Michigan. It is currently undergoing a massive overhaul, creating a more
                            park&#8209like oasis, and introducing a taller ferris wheel with enclosed cars.
